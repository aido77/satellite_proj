this project is supposed to be a project where I scrape live satellite data from the internet 
and use it to create a 3d model and plot the data that has been scraped on that model

it is for my computer science a level project

started 14.11.23
i do everything here and i should probably continue doing everything here
feel free to steal my shitass code
